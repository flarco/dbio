            description: Replication method to use for extracting data from the database.
                STANDARD replication requires no setup on the DB side but will not
                be able to represent deletions incrementally. CDC uses the Binlog
                to detect inserts, updates, and deletes. This needs to be configured
                on the source database itself.
